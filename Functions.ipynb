    "Theory Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "   - A function in Python is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific, related action. It can be called independently from              anywhere in the program [1]. A method, on the other hand, is also a function, but it is defined within a class (or struct) and can only be called      on an instance (object) of that class [1]. It inherently operates on the data contained within that specific object instance.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Example Function:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "               def greet(name): # Function definition\n",
    "                   return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n",
    "               greet(\"Alice\") # Function call\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Example Method:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "               class Dog:\n",
    "                   def bark(self): # Method definition within a class\n",
    "                       return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "                my_dog = Dog()\n",
    "                my_dog.bark() # Method call on an object instance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "   - A parameter is a variable defined in the function signature (the function's definition header) that acts as a placeholder for the values the           function needs to operate [1].\n",
    "     An argument is the actual value passed to the function when it is called [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "              def add_numbers(x, y): # x and y are parameters\n",
    "                  return x + y\n",
    "              add_numbers(5, 3) # 5 and 3 are arguments\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "   - Functions are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and a colon. They are called using the           function name followed by arguments in parentheses [1].\n",
    "  \n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "               def power(base, exp): # Definition\n",
    "                   return base ** exp\n",
    "\n",
    "               # Call with positional arguments\n",
    "               power(2, 3) # Result: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "               # Call with keyword arguments\n",
    "               power(exp=3, base=2) # Result: 8\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. What is the purpose of the \"return' statement in a Python function?\n",
    "   - The return statement immediately terminates the execution of a function and sends the specified value back to the caller [1]. If no value is           specified, the function returns None by default. It is used to produce an output from the function's execution [1].\n",
    "  \n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "             def get_status(is_online):\n",
    "                 if is_online:\n",
    "                     return \"Online\" # Returns \"Online\" and exits\n",
    "                 return \"Offline\" # Returns \"Offline\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "   - An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. It is an object that can be \"iterated over,\" such as a list,          tuple, string, or dictionary [1]. It has an __iter__ method that returns an iterator [1].\n",
    "     An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It is an object that can maintain its state during iteration [1]. It implements two         methods: __iter__ (returns itself) and __next__ (returns the next value in the sequence and raises StopIteration when finished) [1]. You can           explicitly get an iterator from an iterable using the built-in iter() function [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "             my_list = [1, 2, 3] # Iterable\n",
    "             my_iterator = iter(my_list) # Get an iterator\n",
    "             print(next(my_iterator)) # Calls __next__, prints 1\n",
    "             print(next(my_iterator)) # Prints 2\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "   - Generators are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They are defined like regular functions but use the yield statement instead of       return [1]. When called, a generator function does not return all the values at once; instead, it returns a generator object (an iterator) that        poduces values one at a time, pausing its execution state after each yield [1].\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "             def count_up_to(max_val):\n",
    "                 count = 1\n",
    "                 while count <= max_val:\n",
    "                 yield count # Pauses execution and yields current count\n",
    "                 count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "             counter = count_up_to(3) # Creates a generator object\n",
    "             print(next(counter)) # Prints 1\n",
    "             print(next(counter)) # Prints 2\n",
    "     \n",
    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "   - Memory Efficiency: Generators compute values on the fly and only one item exists in memory at any given time, making them ideal for processing         large datasets or infinite sequences [1].\n",
    "     Lazy Evaluation: They don't generate all values upfront, which means they are faster when you only need a few items from a large potential             sequence [1].\n",
    "     Cleaner Code: They often lead to more concise and readable code for creating iterators compared to manually defining classes with __iter__ and         __next__ methods [1].\n",
    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "   - A lambda function is a small, anonymous (nameless) function in Python [1]. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression       [1]. They are typically used for short operations where a full function definition would be unnecessarily verbose, commonly within functions like      map(), filter(), or as key functions for sort() [1].\n",
    "  \n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "           # Traditional function\n",
    "           def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "               return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "           # Equivalent lambda function\n",
    "           multiply_lambda = lambda x, y: x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "           multiply_lambda(3, 4) # Result: 12\n",
    "           \n",
    "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the \"map() function in Python.\n",
    "   - The map() function executes a specified function for each item in an iterable and returns a map object (an iterator) of the results [1]. It is         used to apply the same transformation to every element in a sequence efficiently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "     Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "           numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "           # Use lambda to square each number\n",
    "           squared_numbers_map = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "           print(list(squared_numbers_map)) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between map()\", \"reduce()', and 'filter() functions in Python?\n",
    "    - map(): Applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable of the transformed items (one-to-one transformation) [1].\n",
    "      filter(): Applies a function (that returns True or False) to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable containing only the items for         which the function returned True (subset selection) [1].\n",
    "      reduce(): Applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single cumulative         value [1]. (Note: reduce() is in the functools module in Python 3 and not a built-in function [1].)\n",
    "\n",
    "      Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "            from functools import reduce\n",
    "            data = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "            # map: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "            list(map(lambda x: x*x, data)) \n",
    "\n",
    "            # filter: [2, 4]\n",
    "            list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, data)) \n",
    "\n",
    "            # reduce: 1+2+3+4 = 10\n",
    "            reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, data) \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on this given list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
    "    - The reduce() function iteratively applies a binary function to the items of a list. For the list [47, 11, 42, 13] and the operation sum                (addition):\n",
    "      Step 1: The function is called with the first two elements: sum(47, 11). The result is 58.\n",
    "      Step 2: The result from the previous step (58) is used as the first argument, and the next element from the list (42) is the second argument:          sum(58, 42). The result is 100.\n",
    "      Step 3: The new result (100) is used as the first argument, and the final element from the list (13) is the second argument: sum(100, 13). The         final result is 113.\n",
